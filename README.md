A 3D graphics engine used to investigate and implement features I find interesting. 
Current features: 
- Water rendering with reflections, refractions and moving water
- Basic lighting model
- Normal mapping
- 3D model loading (obj files)
- Texture loading and sampling
- Terrain rendering (height & slope-based colouring)
- Cube mapping (sky-box)
